# Train-Schedule
A simple program that returns a train schedule of your creation.

## Description ##
Made using Firebase to send and receive information in real time

This program also uses:

* jQuery 
* Bootstrap 4.3
* JavaScript 
* Moment.js

## Basics ##

The onclick handles taking the user's input and saving it to variables that are then pushed Firebase in an object. Each time Firebase receives new information, it stores that in the snapshot which is then saved to new variables so next arrival and minutes away can be calculated, as well as appending to the HTML.

## Roadmap ##

I'd say this accomplished all it was meant to!

## Shout Outs ##
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are my favorite bromance.
